            <ul>

              <p>Established under the Morrill Act of 1862, which provided federal funding for land-grant colleges, Prairie View initially operated in a rented building with just two faculty members. Despite the limited resources, the institution quickly garnered support from the local community and prominent figures such as Booker T. Washington, who recognized the importance of education in advancing the rights and opportunities of African Americans.</p>

              <p>In 1887, under the leadership of President Edward L. Blackshear, the institution relocated to its current campus in Prairie View, Texas. This move marked a significant milestone in its development, providing a permanent home for academic pursuits and fostering a sense of community among students, faculty, and staff.</p>

              <p>Throughout its early years, Prairie View faced numerous challenges, including inadequate funding, segregation, and discrimination. Despite these obstacles, the institution remained steadfast in its commitment to providing quality education and expanding opportunities for African American students.</p>

              <p>By the turn of the 20th century, Prairie View had evolved into a thriving institution, offering a range of academic programs and becoming a cornerstone of higher education for African Americans in Texas and beyond. Its founding principles of resilience, perseverance, and academic excellence continue to shape the university's identity to this day.</p>
