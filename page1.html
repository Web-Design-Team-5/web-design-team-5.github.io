            The Prairie View A&M Computer Science Department is facing a challenge: more students than ever are eager to learn about technology. 
            To keep up, we not only need more professors but better ones too - professors who love their jobs and make students excited about learning. 
            It's not just about numbers; it's about giving students the best possible experience. 
            With more enthusiastic professors, we can offer a wider range of courses and ensure every student gets the support they need.
             Plus, new faces bring fresh ideas and energy to our community. By investing in passionate faculty, we're investing in our students' futures.
